# Hi there
My name is Konstantin and welcome to my personal blog!

I'm glad to announce that I've started my fabulous DevOps path 
and I solemnly swear to share all useful knowledge I get on the way.

For now, I'm learning Linux (RHCSA), networking (CCNA) and Go. 
Basic stuff goes first, but I plan to gradually complicate articles (as I learn new). Hope this blog will be usuful for all of us.
