      <description>No more hidden secrets. Not only Vault is used for storing secrets. You can keep them right in your Rancher environment. Though, if you may easily view values in Vault, in Rancher you have to know where to look for.
You can list your secrets, and view a particular one in API. That&amp;rsquo;s what I did, and saw:
 value: null
 Still, I was sure the secret had been set.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s hard to quit using it. But just for the first time. After notepad++ on Windows, linux terminal text editors look unusual. Nano is just simple with prompts, otherwise vim is hard to handle. First time I opened vim, I had to close terminal itself, because I didn&amp;rsquo;t realize how to quit. I watched some Sander van Vugt&amp;rsquo;s explanations on using vim, before I returned to it. And finally weeks later I revealed vim tutor, which is definitely a firm first step.</description>
