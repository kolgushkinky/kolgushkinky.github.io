# It's hard to quit using it. But just for the first time. 

After notepad++ on Windows, linux terminal text editors look unusual. Nano is just simple with prompts, otherwise vim is hard to handle. First time I opened vim, I had to close terminal itself, because I didn't realize how to quit. I watched some Sander van Vugt's explanations on using vim, before I returned to it. And finally weeks later I revealed vim tutor, which is definitely a firm first step. Just type 
<br><br>
> `vimtutor`

and learn by practising.
Vim is not that hard as it firstly seems.
